# Final Project â€“ Employee Manager

This project was developed as part of my final project during my further education program. It is a simple web-based employee management system. The application was built using plain JavaScript. Core features include displaying employee lists, adding new employees, searching and filtering employee data, editing and deleting existing entries, as well as using the browser's built in Local Storage to make the employee data available across browser sessions.
